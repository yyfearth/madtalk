MadTalk is a group chat server application, designed to be used by _geeks_ ;-)

This is **NOT** a fork of the [node_chat](https://github.com/ry/node_chat). These project is developed independently from it as well as other similar projects, but we leart the concept and borrowed parts of the theme from the it but totally rewrited.

MadTalk is built on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and depend on [Socket.IO](http://socket.io/). And it write in a customized version of [CoffeeScript](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script) called [eXtraCoffeeScript](https://github.com/yyfearth/coffee-script) which included some extra features such as `import`, `cson` and `minify`.

MadTalk supports [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and [GFM (Github Flavored Markdown)](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/) in the message. And it has a [audio](http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-audio-element) and [desktop notification](http://www.w3.org/TR/notifications/) when new messages come if user is away from it.
